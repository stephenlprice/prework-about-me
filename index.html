      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a former Sales Engineer with previous experience in Business Intelligence (Tableau) and OpenAPI (Stoplight). 
        Before starting the Coding Boot Camp I had created a Django App for a personal blog using the Wagtail CMS. I have 
        embedded responsive Tableau dashboards using their JS API. I also played around with their R and Python extensions 
        as well as Wed Data Connectors. Additionally I am also familiar with OpenAPI for web API design. I can validate OAS 
        with style guides and spin up mock servers.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Quito, Ecuador. After working in oil & gas for two and a half years I saved up some money
        and moved to Austin, TX to look for a tech job. I had nothing to my name and was living off a couch (shared it with
        a dog) belonging to one of my good childhood friends that had recentlym gotten married. I was able to land a job at 
        Tableau as a Product Consultant (Inside Sales Consultant) supporting the LATAM region.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Going out to dance and visiting bars on the weekend for social interactions. I really like languages and I'm currently 
        taking Portuguese classes. I can speak English and Spanish fluently. I have a basic to intermediate fluency in Brazilian 
        Portuguese and Mandarin Chinese. Coding has mostly been a hobby for me up to this point. It helped me secure growth 
        opportunities as a Sales Engineer and now I want nothing more than to pursue a role that is entirely devoted to software 
        and technology as a developer.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be to become a web developer, ideally one that can also get exposed to data science projects. I know 
        there is a very interesting intersection between web dev, data science and energy right here in Texas. I am open to work as 
        a developer for other projects and I am also willing to relocate if necessary. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>North Austin, about 10 minutes away from UT.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I always found coding very rewarding and I can't ignore how much pleasure I feel after learning something new. I think that 
        web developers are both engineers and artists, having the ability to build sophisticated and engaging experiences. I kept 
        getting drawn into the more technical side of the job as a Sales Engineer and I am convinced that I need to explore this line 
        of work to find something that I truly find fulfilling.
